        <h2 class="aboutus">About Us</h3>
        <h4 class="aboutus">Our Mission</h4>
        <p class="article">Dream Nest is a magazine that informs and provides a service to occupiers of space in their early 20’s to mid 30’s on how to use minimalist style to create a trendy, accessible, and sustainable space.</p>
        <h4 class="aboutus">A little about our mission and purpose</h4>

        <p class="article">Dream Nest focuses on home design in a fun, accessible, collaborative, and sustainable way. We appeal to smaller spaces for younger people in urban cities. We recognize our audience as space occupiers in a difficult real estate market whose funds are limited. Females in their early 20’s to mid 30’s with lower income but are educated and value aesthetically pleasing environments. We make beautiful home design possible within the parameters of being a millennial. Price is major consideration we take into account when imagining our content so readers can create a space that can be achieved by themselves. Through image and editorial content readers will develop a unique and affordable aesthetic using elements from the magazine to gain inspiration on design, home renovation, and decluttering. Come dream with us!</p>

        <h4 class="aboutus">A little about our business</h4>
        <p class="article">Dream Nest publishes a monthly print edition and a daily digital edition. Our 48 page print edition will be distributed to subscribers, newsstands, and local shops; commercial and private. On our website, we will have content being produced daily. Our newsletter subscribers will receive exclusive content and can contribute to our social media and online content sharing with what they have done with their own spaces that inspire us!</p>
